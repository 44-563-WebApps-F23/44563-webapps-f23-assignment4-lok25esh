<h3 class="NORA">NORA</h3>
<p class="speech">There is a shilling. No, keep the change..</p>
<p class="direction"> [The PORTER thanks her, and
goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
listens.]_ Yes, he is in. _[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
right.]_</p>

<h3 class="HELMER">HELMER</h3>
<p class="direction">_[calls out from his room]_.</p>
<p class="speech"> Is that my little lark twittering out
there?<p>

<h3 class="NORA">NORA.</h3>
<p class="direction">_[busy opening some of the parcels]_.</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, it is!</p>

<h3 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h3>
<p class="speech">Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>

<h3 class="NORA">NORA.</h3>
<p class="speech">Yes!</p>

<h3 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h3>
<p class="speech">When did my squirrel come home?</p>
<h3 class="NORA">NORA.</h3>
<p class="speech">Just now.</p>
 <p class="direction">_[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
    mouth.]_</p> 
 <p class="speech">Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>

<h3 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h3>
<p class="speech">Don’t disturb me.</p>
<p class="direction">_[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
the room, pen in hand.]_</p>  
<p class="speech">Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
little spendthrift been wasting money again?y</p>

<h3 class="NORA">NORA.</h3>
<p class="speech">Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p>
<h3 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h3>
<p class="speech">Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.</p>

<h3 class="NORA">NORA.</h3>
<p class="speech">Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
of money.</p>

<h3 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h3>
<p class="speech">Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
salary is due.</p>
<h3 class="NORA">NORA.</h3>
<p class="speech">Pooh! we can borrow until then.</p>

<h3 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h3>
<p class="speech">Nora! </p>
<p class="direction">_[Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]_</p> 
<p class="speech">The same
little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,
and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year’s Eve
a slate fell on my head and killed me, and—</p>

<h3 class="NORA">NORA.</h3>
<p class="direction">_[putting her hands over his mouth]_.</p>
<p class="speech">Oh! don’t say such horrid things.</p> 
<h3 class="HELMER">HELMER.</h3>
<p class="speech">Still, suppose that happened,—what then?</p>
