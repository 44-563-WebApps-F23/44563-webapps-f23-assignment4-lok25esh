<p>NORA.
There is a shilling. No, keep the change. _[The PORTER thanks her, and
goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
listens.]_ Yes, he is in. _[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
right.]_<p>

<p>HELMER.
_[calls out from his room]_. Is that my little lark twittering out
there?<p>

<p>NORA.
_[busy opening some of the parcels]_. Yes, it is!<p>

<p>HELMER.
Is it my little squirrel bustling about?<p>

<p>>NORA.
Yes!<p>

<p>HELMER.
When did my squirrel come home?<p>
<p>NORA.
Just now. _[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
mouth.]_ Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.<p>

<p>HELMER.
Don’t disturb me. _[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
the room, pen in hand.]_ Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
little spendthrift been wasting money again?y<p>

<p>NORA.
Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.<p>
<p>HELMER.
Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.<p>

<p>NORA.
Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
of money.<p>

<p>HELMER.
Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
salary is due.<p>
<p>NORA.
Pooh! we can borrow until then.<p>

<p>HELMER.
Nora! _[Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]_ The same
little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,
and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year’s Eve
a slate fell on my head and killed me, and—<p>

<p>NORA.
_[putting her hands over his mouth]_. Oh! don’t say such horrid things.<p>
<p>HELMER.
Still, suppose that happened,—what then?<p>

<p>NORA.
If that were to happen, I don’t suppose I should care whether I owed
money or not.<p>

<p>HELMER.
Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?<p>
<p>NORA.
They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.<p>

<p>HELMER.
That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about
that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a
home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely
on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for the
short time longer that there need be any struggle.<p>

<p>NORA.
_[moving towards the stove]_. As you please, Torvald.
