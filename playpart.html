    <h1>Kallepalli_Lokesh “acts in a play”</h1>
    <h6>A Doll’s House  Act 1-Henrik Ibsen</h6>
    <p>
<h3>NORA</h3>
<p>There is a shilling. No, keep the change..</p>
<p> [The PORTER thanks her, and
goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
listens.]_ Yes, he is in. _[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
right.]_</p>

<h3>HELMER</h3>
<p>_[calls out from his room]_.</p>
<p> Is that my little lark twittering out
there?<p>

<h3>NORA.</h3>
<p>_[busy opening some of the parcels]_.</p>
<p>Yes, it is!</p>

<h3>HELMER.</h3>
<p>Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>

<h3>NORA.</h3>
<p>Yes!</p>

<h3>HELMER.</h3>
<p>When did my squirrel come home?</p>
<h3>NORA.</h3>
<p>Just now.</p> <p>_[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
    mouth.]_</p>  <p>Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>

<h3>HELMER.</h3>
<p>Don’t disturb me.</p>
<p>_[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
the room, pen in hand.]_</p>  
<p>Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
little spendthrift been wasting money again?y</p>

<h3>NORA.</h3>
<p>Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p>
<h3>HELMER.</h3>
<p>Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.</p>

<h3>NORA.</h3>
<p>Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
of money.</p>

<h3>HELMER.</h3>
<p>Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
salary is due.</p>
<h3>NORA.</h3>
<p>Pooh! we can borrow until then.</p>

<h3>HELMER.</h3>
<p>Nora! </p>
<p>_[Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]_</p> <p>The same
little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,
and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year’s Eve
a slate fell on my head and killed me, and—</p>

<h3>NORA.</h3>
<p>_[putting her hands over his mouth]_.</p>
<p>Oh! don’t say such horrid things.</p> 
<h3>HELMER.</h3>
<p>Still, suppose that happened,—what then?</p>
